## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size

- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

- Adjust the color theme based on their preference

- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While building the project, I learned how to store data and variables in HTML elements using the `[data-*]` attribute.

I also learned how to use the `querySelectorAll()` method to get specific elements or elements with specific classes or id

I also practiced looping through arrays using the `forEach()` loop

### Continued development

I wish to practice storing data in HTML elements

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me understand how to use the `eval()` function to perform mathematical operations
